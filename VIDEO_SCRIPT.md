# HatchMark — 3-Minute Video Script

## [0:00 - 0:20] HOOK — The Problem (20 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Split screen showing AI-generated art vs. real photos]**

**NARRATOR:**
"AI can now generate photorealistic images in seconds. But here's the problem: how do artists and photographers prove they created something *first*? Copyright disputes today rely on centralized platforms making arbitrary decisions. There's no trustless way to establish provenance."

## [0:20 - 0:45] SOLUTION — Introducing HatchMark (25 seconds)

**[VISUAL: HatchMark logo animation, then homepage at hatchmark.vercel.app]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Meet **HatchMark** — a blockchain-powered content authenticity platform built on Sui. We're creating a new consumer primitive for the Provenance Economy: trustless, timestamped proof of creation. Think of it like a copyright timestamp that lives on-chain, forever."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Register → Verify → Protect"]**

## [0:45 - 1:35] DEMO — Core Features (50 seconds)

### PART 1: Register (20 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Screen recording of upload flow]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Here's how it works. First, **Register** your original content. Upload your image, and we compute a perceptual hash — a unique digital fingerprint that survives cropping, resizing, even compression. Connect your Sui wallet, and boom — an immutable certificate is minted on-chain with your ownership timestamp."

**[SHOW: Certificate with QR code downloading]**

### PART 2: Verify (15 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Verify page with suspect image being uploaded]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Second, **Verify** any suspect image. Upload it, and HatchMark checks it against our indexed registry. If there's a match, you'll see the original creator, registration date, and similarity score."

**[SHOW: Match result with 94% similarity]**

### PART 3: Flag & Dispute (15 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Flagging interface and dashboard showing disputes]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Third, **Flag** unauthorized use. Create an on-chain dispute by staking SUI tokens. Original creators can review and resolve disputes transparently — no centralized authority needed. Everything lives on the blockchain."

## [1:35 - 2:10] TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS (35 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Architecture diagram, then code snippets]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Under the hood, HatchMark uses Sui Move smart contracts for tamper-proof certificate storage. Our perceptual hashing runs client-side for privacy. Supabase indexes blockchain events for lightning-fast lookups. And we've built a browser extension — right-click any image on the web to verify its authenticity instantly."

**[VISUAL: Browser extension demo — right-click → verify]**

"The tech stack: Next.js 15, Sui blockchain, TypeScript, and a custom indexer. All open source."

## Alternative 30-Second Elevator Pitch (Bonus)

**NARRATOR:**
"AI generates images in seconds. Artists can't prove they made something first. HatchMark solves this: upload your image, we compute a perceptual hash, mint an on-chain certificate on Sui. Verify suspect images instantly. Flag unauthorized use with transparent disputes. Trustless copyright for the AI age. Live now at hatchmark.vercel.app."
