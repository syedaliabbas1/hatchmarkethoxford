# LinkedIn Post - Hatchmark at ETHOxford

---

🚀 **We got selected to present at ETHOxford!** 🚀

Thrilled to share that our team got the opportunity to pitch **Hatchmark** to the judges at ETHOxford — a blockchain-powered solution tackling one of the biggest challenges in the AI era: **proving who created content first**.

## 🎯 **The Problem**

AI can generate photorealistic images in seconds. Artists lose credit. Companies face copyright disputes. Content platforms struggle with authenticity. And there's no trustless way to prove provenance.

Traditional copyright systems are centralized, slow, and expensive. In 2026, we needed something better.

## 💡 **What We Built**

**Hatchmark** is a decentralized content authenticity platform built on @Sui blockchain that enables creators to register image ownership on-chain using perceptual hashing — providing timestamped, immutable copyright protection.

**Here's how it works:**
✅ **Register** — Upload your image → compute perceptual hash → mint an on-chain certificate  
✅ **Verify** — Check any suspect image against our indexed registry  
✅ **Flag** — Create transparent on-chain disputes with SUI staking  
✅ **AI Detection** — Identify AI-generated content during registration

## 🏢 **Why This Matters for Businesses**

Think about the use cases:
📸 **News organizations** — Verify source images before publication  
🎨 **Creative agencies** — Protect client assets and original work  
🏛️ **Legal teams** — Establish timestamped evidence for IP disputes  
🖼️ **Stock photo platforms** — Combat unauthorized redistribution  
🤖 **AI companies** — Prove training data provenance and licensing

The perceptual hashing survives cropping, resizing, and compression — so even modified content gets caught.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

Built in 36 hours with:
- **Sui blockchain** (Move smart contracts) for immutable storage
- **Next.js 15** + TypeScript frontend
- **Perceptual hashing** (client-side for privacy)
- **Supabase** for event indexing
- **Chrome extension** for instant verification

**It's live on Sui Testnet right now** → hatchmark.vercel.app

## 🌟 **What Makes It Special**

🔹 **Decentralized** — No single authority, no censorship  
🔹 **Fast** — Sui blockchain enables instant finality  
🔹 **Private** — Hashing happens client-side  
🔹 **Transparent** — All disputes are on-chain  
🔹 **Browser-integrated** — Right-click any image to verify

## 🎉 **Try It Yourself**

Visit **hatchmark.vercel.app** and register your first image on testnet (no gas fees!). See how trustless copyright protection works in the Provenance Economy.

Huge shoutout to @Maaz and @Sameer for building this with me, and to @ETHOxford and @Sui for creating an amazing environment to innovate.

**The future of content authenticity is on-chain. Will your company be ready?**
